GPA 4.0, 1st in Class Honors

## Experience
### Research Intern | Laboratory for Metabolic Systems Engineering (Jul 2023-Present)   
*University of Toronto* Toronto, CAN
  •	Created a framework using Python for the refinement of Genome-Scale Metabolic Models (GEMs), incorporating methods of linear and non-linear programming
  •	Incorporated deep learning-predicted kinetic constraints to improve the accuracy of the GEMs.
  •	Designed a framework that efficiently processes omics information across multiple databases.

### Organizing Committee| Biomolecule Research Lab Symposium (Feb 2023–Jun 2023)   
*Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education* Puebla, Mexico
  •	Organized the first edition of a scientific research symposium, featuring participation from national and international researchers as speakers, with sponsorship from the biotechnology enterprise Sartorius.  
  •	Incorporated deep learning-predicted kinetic constraints to improve the accuracy of the GEMs.
  •	Designed a framework that efficiently processes omics information across multiple databases.
